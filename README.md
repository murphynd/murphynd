# Hello, I am Natalie

> I love deconstructing big ideas into buildable tools.

## About Me

I am a developer working mainly in Java and Javascript on a business optimization platform after studying at Epicodus in Portland, OR, focusing on C#. I'll be skiing at Timberline this winter if you want to join. I graduated from Appalachian State University with a degree in Public Relations. Excited to build a career in technology and grow with the ever-changing times. I am always searching for new opportunities for exploring the world. I am a big coffee nerd and part-time ski instructor. 🎿

## What I've done

🔰 Completed a 27-week/800 hr developer bootcamp through [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

🔰 C#/.NET, Java, Javascript, and so much more.
